# Hi there, Caio here! ðŸ‘‹
Passionate for startup environment, building teams and relations, focusing heavily on the problem and not the solution.

I see coding as a way to solve problems, not as an end.

I love beer, coffee, games and metal (my favourite band is Metallica, ask me anything about any album ðŸ˜›)!

- ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working at Hutch Games @ F1 Clash as a Server Engineer. 

### ðŸ“– Some of the books that helped me become a better engineer:
- What you do is Who you are (Ben Horowitz)
- No rules rule (Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer)
- Clean Architecture (Robert Martin)
- Dive into design patterns (Refactoring Guru)
- Production-Ready Microservices (Susan Fowler)
- Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans)
