# Hi there, Caio here! 👋
Passionate for startup environment, building teams and relations, focusing heavily on the problem and not the solution.

I see coding as a way to solve problems, not as an end.

I love beer, coffee, games and metal (my favourite band is Metallica, ask me anything about any album 😛)!

- 💼 I’m currently working at Wildlife Studios @ Multiplayer Squad as a Backend Engineer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about design patterns and software architecture.

### 📖 Some of the books that helped me become a better engineer:
- What you do is Who you are (Ben Horowitz)
- No rules rule (Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer)
- Clean Architecture (Robert Martin)
- Dive into design patterns (Refactoring Guru)
- Production-Ready Microservices (Susan Fowler)
- Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans)
