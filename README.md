# Hi there, Caio here! ğŸ‘‹
Passionate for startup environment, building teams and relations, focusing heavily on the problem and not the solution.

I see coding as a way to solve problems, not as an end.

I love beer, coffee, games and metal (my favourite band is Metallica, ask me anything about any album ğŸ˜›)!

- ğŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working at Wildlife Studios @ Multiplayer Squad as a Backend Engineer. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about design patterns and software architecture.

### ğŸ“– Books that helped me become a better engineer:
- What you do is Who you are (Ben Horowitz)
- No rules rule (Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer)
- Clean Architecture (Robert Martin)
- Dive into design patterns (Refactoring Guru)
