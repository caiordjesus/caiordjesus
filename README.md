### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
Passionate for startup environment, building teams and relations, focusing heavly on the problem and not the solution.

I see coding as a way to solve problems, not as an end.

I love beer, coffee, games and metal (my favourite band is Metallica, ask me anything about any album ðŸ˜›)!

- ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working at Wildlife Studios @ Multiplayer Squad of Game Services team. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about design patterns and software architecture.

### ðŸ“– My favourite books (till now) are:
- What you do is Who you are (Ben Horowitz)
- The Culture Map (Erin Meyer)
- No rules rule (Reed Hastings, Erin Meyer)
